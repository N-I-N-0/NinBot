# NinBot

This is a Discord bot used on [this](https://discord.gg/4s72Nnm) Discord Server.

Feel free to use the code for your own bot as described in the `LICENSE` file.

Most bot commands are supposed to be used only by the server owner. You will have to overwrite the id used in the if statements to use those commands.

Apart from those commands, the bot has methods to make it easy for every member to assign roles to themselves (have a look at the `send_roles_embed` method and the `reaction_add/remove_loop` methods).
